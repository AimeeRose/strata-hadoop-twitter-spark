SUMMARY:Ideas that Matter
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Tim Harford (The Financial Times). We're always
  talking about "innovation", but - says Tim Harford - there are really t
 wo very different kinds of innovation. Using stories from sport, science
 , music and military history, Tim will make you think different about wh
 ere good ideas come from and how they should be encouraged.

SUMMARY:Deploying machine learning in production
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Alice Zheng (Dato). Building and deploying pred
 ictive applications require knowing how to evaluate, test, and track the
  performance of machine learning models over time. Using available off-t
 he-shelf tools, this talk engages potential application builders on topi
 cs such as common evaluation metrics, A/B testing set up, tracking model
  performance, tracking usage via real-time feedback, and updating models
 .

SUMMARY:What we are made of: Analyzing the human genome with SQL
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Felipe Hoffa (Google). How big is the human gen
 ome? What tools can we use to manage and understand it? Turns out the sa
 me tools used for traditional purposes (Hadoop, Spark, BigQuery, Dataflo
 w, and SQL) can be applied to genomics. In this session we'll introduce 
 the basics of managing genomes with our favorite big data tools, and dra
 w parallels with more traditional use cases like analyzing view logs.

SUMMARY:What's there to know about A/B testing?
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Noel Welsh (Underscore Consulting). A/B testing
  is easy; it's just an application of hypothesis testing, taught in ever
 y first year stats course. My goal in this talk is to convince you that 
 this view is wrong. There is a lot of subtlety in creating a meaningful 
 test, and this subtlety is important in practice. I'll cover issues from
  methodology to epistemology, giving insights and tools directly applica
 ble to practice.

SUMMARY:Measuring the benefit effect for customers with Bayesian predict
 ive modeling
DESCRIPTION:Presented by JeongMin Kwon (SK Planet). Offering benefits is
  a classic and important strategy for acquisition of new customers and c
 hurn management. For measuring benefits with data, this model combines m
 ultivariate testing like A/B testing and Bayesian time series prediction
  modeling. The model is implemented in an R and CausalImpact package. Th
 is presentation will demonstrate the model structure and provide a case 
 study.

SUMMARY:Forecasting space-time events
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Jeremy Heffner (Azavea). We often face the need
  to analyze the count of discrete events which occur at a specific time 
 and place, whether they are crime events, taxi requests, or phone calls.
   Forecasting these space-time events brings particular challenges: find
 ing suitable tools for geographic processing, and techniques for modelin
 g the data.  The session will cover the lessons learned in building such
  a system.

SUMMARY:Deep learning made doubly easy with reusable deep features
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Carlos Guestrin (Dato). Deep learning is a prom
 ising machine learning technique with a high barrier to entry. In this t
 alk, we provide an easy entry into this field via "deep features" from p
 re-trained models. These features can be trained on one data set for one
  task and used to obtain good predictions on a different task, on a diff
 erent data set. No prior experience is necessary.

SUMMARY:A taste of random decision forests on Apache Spark
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Sean Owen (Cloudera). Apache Spark has a lot to
  like for the data scientist: natively distributed, REPL, Scala and Pyth
 on APIs, and a machine learning library, MLlib. Spark 1.2 includes an im
 plementation of random decision forests, an important classifier/regress
 or algorithm. This talk will introduce Spark, Scala, and random decision
  forests, and demonstrate the process of analyzing a real-world data set
  with them.

SUMMARY:Poor man's parallel pipelines
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Jeroen Janssens (Elsevier). Hadoop, Storm, and 
 Spark are fantastic frameworks for processing massive amounts of data in
  parallel. Every now and then, there is a one-off data science task that
  could really use some speeding up. For those kinds of tasks, it's proba
 bly not worthwhile to set up large frameworks. This presentation demonst
 rates GNU Parallel, which allows you to easily parallelize and distribut
 e such tasks.

SUMMARY:Users love Spark. Does Spark love (multiple) users?
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Richard Shaw (MapR). Apache Spark is a powerful
 , unified data processing engine offering a number of APIs, from batch/S
 QL over streaming to manipulations over graphs. The core architecture of
  Spark has not necessarily been designed with a multi-user environment i
 n mind. We will review existing and emerging approaches how to use Spark
  in multi-user environments, such as the Tachyon project.

SUMMARY:Fast > Perfect: Practical approximation examples for mobile app 
 analytics using Spark Streaming
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Kevin Schmidt (Mind Candy Ltd), Luis Angel Vice
 nte Sanchez (Mind Candy Ltd.). Mobile gaming is a fast-moving field and 
 needs metrics like daily active users or revenue in real-time to be able
  to fine-tune quickly. Approximation is needed to count those metrics, a
 s the data volume would be too large to process exactly in real-time. We
  will demonstrate how to use Spark Streaming and probabilistic data stru
 ctures to achieve a low error rate, even for many millions of users.

SUMMARY:The curiosity advantage: the most important skill for data scien
 ce
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Oana Calugar (AliveShoes ). Curiosity is one of
  the most valued skills for people working in Data Science. But how can 
 we train it? Einstein said that "Curiosity is an important trait of a ge

 es in the session: how to find pleasure in uncertainty; question the que
 stion we’re asking; and find a beginner's mind. With direct application 
 to data science.

SUMMARY:Multi-model databases and the art of aircraft maintenance
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Max Neunhöffer (ArangoDB GmbH). We present a co

 t data models (documents and graphs) in the same database engine using a
  common query language. A single aircraft already contains some 6,000,00
 0 parts, not counting components. Any single data model inevitably leads
  to inefficient queries, though queries are nevertheless crucial for the
  application.
